/**
 * Button-tap gate for interstitial + rewarded, LOAD ON DEMAND.
 * Owns the loading dialog (shown while the ad loads).
 *
 *   val gate = rememberAdGate()
 *   Button(onClick = { gate.showInterstitial("key") { proceed() } }) { }
 *   gate.showRewarded("key", onEarned = { unlock() })
 *
 * ROBUST: the caller's callbacks (which often navigate) are NOT executed inside
 * the ad-dismiss callback — that fires at an unpredictable lifecycle moment and
 * navigating there throws IllegalStateException. Instead they are queued and run
 * by a LaunchedEffect within the composition lifecycle, where navigation is safe.
