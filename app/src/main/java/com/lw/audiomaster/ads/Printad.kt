/**
 * Print-button ad gate — shows an interstitial on EVERY print, with the
 * app-styled loading dialog while it loads.
 *
 *   val printAd = rememberPrintAd()
 *   Button(onClick = { printAd { PrintUtils.printPdf(context, file) } }) { }
 *
 * Ad shows → dismiss → action runs. Premium/gated/failed → action runs directly.
 *
 * ROBUST: the caller's action (which often navigates) is NOT executed inside
 * the ad-dismiss callback — that fires at an unpredictable lifecycle moment and
 * navigating there throws IllegalStateException. Instead the callback stores the
 * action, and a LaunchedEffect runs it within the composition's lifecycle, where
 * navigation is always valid.
